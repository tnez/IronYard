        <h2>I ate a frog today</h2>
        <p>
          Today I ate a whole frog. Travis took me outside in the rain
          and while he wasn't paying attention I snatched up a frog
          from the ground and put the whole thing in my mouth! He
          noticed the legs hanging out of my mouth but when he tried
          to get it from me I just swallowed it whole.

        <h2>Today I played with a little dog</h2>
        <p>
          It was little and fluffy and his name was Toby. He bossed me
          around even though I'm a big dog and he is so very little!
