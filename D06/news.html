          <h1>I ate a frog today</h1>
          <p>
            Today I ate a whole frog. Travis took me outside in the rain
            and while he wasn't paying attention I snatched up a frog
            from the ground and put the whole thing in my mouth! He
            noticed the legs hanging out of my mouth but when he tried
            to get it from me I just swallowed it whole.

          <h1>Today I played with a little dog</h1>
          <p>
            It was little and fluffy and his name was Toby. He bossed me
            around even though I'm a big dog and he is so very little!
